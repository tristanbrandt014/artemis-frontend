# Artemis Frontend

Artemis is a simple project managment tool that I am working on. The idea is for it to be a simple entry point for all kinds of projects. It will allow you to add projects, categorise them as you'd like, take notes, add todos and link to other tools. The need for this arose out of my working on many projects, diverse in nature, with no sustainable way to keep track of them.
